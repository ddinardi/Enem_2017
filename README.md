# Enem_2017
Data analysis about the test "Enem 2017".

### Dataset 
The data set used was obtained from the INEP website. Link - http://download.inep.gov.br/microdados/microdados_enem2017.zip

### Data modelling
The dataset from INEP was joined to other dataset for more informations about the cities from Brazil.

### Using
The study can be use to take decisions about, by example, which regions in the Brazil were worst in the test e need more resources for improve their rates.

### Future
This project can be enriched with other dashboards like: comparation with editions of the others years, analysis about how was the performance by category in text production. 
Another interesting upgrade in the project is the ingestion of data. Each dataset has about 7 milions of row, it would be good some agregations before the manipulation in Tableau.
